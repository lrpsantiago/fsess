# FSESS - Formula Space Engineers Standard Script

### Version 12.2.0

This is the standard script that all cars racing on FSE should be using on Season 12 and it features:
- Pit Limiter
- Drag Reduction System (DRS)
- Energy Recovery System (ERS)
- Onboard Race Information
- Tyre Degradation
- Race Flags Effects (Yellow, Red)
- Weather Effects
- Drafting System
- Race Positions Information
- Auto HudLcd Plugin Setup

## How to Setup
1. Place a Programmable Block on your car;
2. Place a Light Panel or a Transparent LCD at the back of your car, then create group with it called "Brakelight";
3. Place a Sensor bellow the tip of your car (facing down and the top of the sensor should be pointing forward the car), then name it "Drafting Sensor";
4. Name each suspension according to their positions, putting: "FR", "FL", "RR", "RL" on their names;
5. Optionally, if your programmable block is not visible from the cockpit, you can place a LCD to show onboard information, name it "Driver LCD";
6. Open the Control Panel, look for your Programmable Block, click on the "Edit" button, then copy and paste the script;
7. Make sure to set the following variables according to your needs:
   - TEAM_TAG => 3 Letters that represents your team, if you're not in a team it's going to be "XXX"
   - DRIVER_NAME => Replace "Guest" to "Your Name"
   - DRIVER_NUMBER => Set a number of your preference from 0 to 99, make sure no other driver uses it.
   - DEFAULT_SUSPENSION_STRENGTH => Set the strength percentage you use on your car suspensions, remember to put an "f" at the end of the number, e.g.: 6.32f;
8. If you want to see onboard race information (Current Lap, Position, Lap Time, Tyre Wear), you must have an Antenna on your car. 
9. Once you have set the values, click on "Check Code" button, a success message should pop-up (if not, repeat the previous steps);
10. After closing the pop-up, click on "OK" on the Editor;
11. Setup the arguments to the Programmable Block on your car's hotbar, so you can execute commands for your cockpit, then you're ready to race.

**Note: After setting this up, your grid name will change to the standardized name "TEAM_TAG #DRIVER_NUMBER-DRIVER_NAME", e.g.: "CPS #21-Cratera".**

## Arguments
Here's a list of all arguments supported by the current script:
- LMT     => Toggle Pit Limiter
- LMT_ON  => Activate Pit Limiter
- LMT_OFF => Deactivate Pit Limiter
- DRS     => Toggle Drag Reduction System (DRS)
- DRS_ON  => Activate DRS
- DRS_OFF => Deactivate DRS
- ERS     => Toggle Energy Recovery System (ERS)
- ERS_ON  => Activate ERS
- ERS_OFF => Deactivate ERS
- ULTRA   => Switch to Ultra Tyres
- SOFT    => Switch to Soft Tyres
- MEDIUM  => Switch to Medium Tyres
- HARD    => Switch to Hard Tyres
- EXTRA   => Switch to Extra Tyres
- INT     => Switch to Intermediate Tyres
- WET     => Switch to Wet Tyres
- FLIP    => Flips the car if it's upside-down (Needs to manually setup gyro override)

## Tyre Degradation
Wheels are going to get less friction overtime, affecting the overall performance of your car. You're going to be able to see the Tyre Wear % on your onboard screen, once it reachs 0% a random wheels is going to pop-off your car as a puncture.

In order to change wheels, you have to go to the pits, with the Pit Limiter active, fully stop your car, then you are going to be able to switch tyres using the arguments: ULTRA, SOFT, MEDIUM, HARD, EXTRA, INT, WET. Notice that once you change tyres, the Tyre Wear % changes to 100%, also a letter going to be displayed reprsenting the selected compound (U, S, M, H, X, I, W) and your Brakelight is going to change the color making your current compound visible to the others. The image bellow show the specs for each compound type:

**Note: For now, the drive style won't matter too much on the tyre degradation rate, it will be pretty similar to everyone. The degradation rate is only based on current speed (even if the wheels are not touching the ground), the faster you go, the faster your tyre will degradate. (At 90m/s it reachs the maximum rate)**

## FAQ
- **How does the DRS works?**
  - It sets the strength of all your suspensions to 100% while active, which allows your car to reach 100m/s. But be careful, it might only be good to use on long straights, also bumpy surfaces might put your car in the air while DRS is active. It's now allowed on FSE1 cars only.
  
- **How does the ERS works?**
  - It sets the power of all your suspensions to 100% and overclocks it while active, which gives more acceleration to your car consuming the ERS charge. When deactivated, it will recharge the ERS while moving.
  
- **How does the Drafting System works?**
  - When you're behind another car (detected by the Drafting Sensor) and you're above 60m/s, your car starts to draft: your suspensions gets 100% wheel power and your speed limit is set to unlimited. It remains active for a little while after moving for the overtake.
  
- **Do I need to setup FSESS script on my car to be detected by the race control script?"**
  - No, once you cross the start line you are already being tracked. But in order to see your onboard race data, using commands and having the tyre degradation effect on your car, you need to setup this script on your car.
  
- **Is there anyway to stop the tyre degradation?**
  - No, unless you turn off your Programable Block (which would be cheating during a race). Make sure to change your tyres before it's too late.

- **Why these values for the tyres?**
  - The lifespans are based on the Fibonacci sequence, notice that if you sum the lifespan of SOFT + MEDIUM = HARD, this allow a good variety of strategies on the races. Also, the friction ranges are planned in a way so all the compounds have 20% of the lifespan bellow 50% friction (we call it the Anchor), so people can optionally push the wheels to the limit even if they are getting a low performance.
